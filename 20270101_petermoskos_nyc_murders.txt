Peter predicts that there will be more murders in NYC in 2026 than there were in 2025.
Harry predicts that there will be less.

For reference NYC had 305 murders in 2025. If 2026 has exactly 305 murders, the bet resolves as a tie.

Winner gets $100 cash OR <=$100 tab at place at loser's choice. Winner picks which.
