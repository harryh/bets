The goal is to "call it" when you think that the s&p 500 will never close below 5,000 again.

Either of us can do so at any time. It's a real time game. A player calls it by sendig an iMessage to the other party.

If, after calling it, the S&P500 closes all remain above 5k for 90 days the caller wins $200.
If, after calling it, the S&P500 ever closes below 5,000 the caller loses $100.

If, after the caller wins, the S&P500 then closes below 5k, the winning caller forfeits his $200 winnings,
and loses $100 so owes the other party $300.

After any loss by a caller, the game reset and is open to be called by either party again.

Todd called it on March 4th 2024. 90 days from that day is June 2, 2024, so close as of May 31st 2024 will be used as 90 days.
The S&P500 closed at 4,967.23 on April 19th, 2024 so Todd lost $100 and the bet reset.
