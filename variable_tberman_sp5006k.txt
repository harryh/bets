The goal is to "call it" when you think that the s&p 500 will never close below 6,000 again.

Either of us can do so at any time. It's a real time game. A player calls it by sendig an iMessage to the other party.

If, after calling it, the S&P500 closes all remain above 6k for 90 days the caller wins $200.
If, after calling it, the S&P500 ever closes below 6,000 the caller loses $100.

If, after the caller wins, the S&P500 then closes below 6k, the winning caller forfeits his $200 winnings,
and loses $100 so owes the other party $300.

After any loss by a caller, the game reset and is open to be called by either party again.

Todd called it on June 25th, 2025. 90 days from that day is September 23, 2025.
