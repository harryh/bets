Patrick's core thesis is that distributed companies will become significantly more common
over the next 5 years. Harry does not believe this will be the case.

As discussed, the bet will resolve on January 1, 2025. On this date we will look at the top 5
YC companies by valuation for all classes starting with the Winter 2020 class. For each of these
comapnies we will decide if a company is distrubuted or not based on the following criteria:

A company counts as distributed if there is no central company HQ campus with over 500 people or
50% of the company workforce.

Patrick wins the bet if fewer than 3 of the 5 companies are NOT distributed.
Harry wins the bet if 3 or more of the companies are NOT distributed.

The loser of the bet will donate $500 to a charity of the winner's choice.
